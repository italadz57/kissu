    <h1> Kissu is a New York City based clothing brand focused around upcycling (reusing donated, thrifted, or old clothes) and creating one of a kind pieces. </h1>
    <h2>Kissu is targeting both people who are passionate about streetwear/fashion and environmentally sustainable ways of production.</h2>
    <p>  A huge amount of clothing goes to waste because of the fashion industry, through manufactured trends and consumerist marketing strategies. Lots of this clothing is perfectly good or salvageable but is thrown away into landfills. Instead, Kissu wants to take these old clothes that are no longer “stylish” and transform them into one of one pieces. These clothes are customized with graphics designed by the Kissu team, which are then screen printed on top of blank clothing or existing graphics. Patchwork items are also produced, with a focus on androgenous silhouettes, which sometimes feature the previously mentioned graphics.</p>
